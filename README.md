# RoarMe

A chat for everyone, by THEMADLIONS (working name). Sign up with an email, pick a @username, find
people by it, talk one to one or in groups, send photos and files. Desktop first.

- App: React + Vite, plain CSS (`src/`). Live at GitHub Pages from `main` (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`).
- Data: Supabase, tables `roar_*` and storage buckets `roar-files`, `roar-avatars` (`supabase/schema.sql`,
  safe to run again). For now in the THEMADLIONS project, separate from the hub's own tables; before
  going public it moves to a project of its own (change `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_KEY` in `src/lib.js`).
- Everyone sees only the chats they are in; this is enforced by the database's row level security.

## What it does (16 Oct)
Everything of the THEMADLIONS chat that does not need new server work: Edit mode on the list (Read,
Archive, Folder, Delete for many chats at once), your own folders, search in chat names and in messages
(⌘K), folder tags, a chat search inside a conversation, pinned message, reactions, reply and replies list,
forward, select, copy text and link, translate, seen-by ticks, @mentions, emoji picker, large emoji,
